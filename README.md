## Current scope

The runtime and stylesheet are consolidated into one file each. The current UI and connection layer include persistent API-key storage, proxy model discovery, a Direct NovelAI provider mode, official native image routing, Vibe Transfer encoding, separate Character Prompts, Precise Reference, image editing, gallery/export, mobile Studio navigation, and the Prompt Assistant. Provider-specific route differences are handled through explicit adapter attempts and surfaced in Request Debug when unsupported.
